This is particularly true for highly nonlinear materials, such as silicon or III-V compounds, where cavities offer extreme enhancements in efficiency that can result in parametric fluorescence with pump powers on the order of microwatts only.\n",

      "Answer: Counter-propagating SFWM (Second-Order Frequency Conversion) refers to a type of Superfluorescent White Light Emission (SFWM) process where two pump photons are launched from opposite ends of the nonlinear medium, such as a fiber or waveguide. In this process, one daughter photon (signal) is emitted in a direction that backpropagates with respect to one of the pumps, while the conjugate idler photon backpropagates with respect to the other pump.\n",
